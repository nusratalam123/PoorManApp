Introduction:
There are many poor people in our country. Government, rich people and many organization wants to help the poor people by donating money. But here is a lack of real information of financial condition of the peoples. As a result its happen that the really poor people deprived of the helps. Sometimes its happen that the poor people don’t know about the donations that was for them. 
We build a system named “Poor Man App” where our poor people will know about every donation for him/her and the donor authorities will able to know about the financial condition of the people of a distinct area. By the app donors will be able to send money to an individual person or persons of an individual area. 
As our system user donors will be able to know about people’s financial condition and the people will be able to know about the donations for them, real poor people will get the donation.

**User:**
*The app connects two types of users: donors offering financial assistance and recipients in need.
*Presumably, the focus is on smaller amounts for immediate needs rather than long-term support.

**Functionality:**
*Users need to register and identify themselves (within acceptable privacy boundaries).
*After login they see receiving history and surounding people.
*Donar need to register and identify themselves.
*Donors could specify available amounts or set up recurring donations.
*Donar pay the people two way One particular people and another send money government.
*Recipients could post requests for specific needs.
*The app facilitates secure transactions,Loaction base, potentially through micropayment systems or integrations with existing payment platforms.
*Features like user reviews and community building could add trust and transparency.


1. Easy Payment:

This suggests the app should facilitate simple and straightforward money transfers between users.
*Integrating with existing payment platforms (e.g.,PayPal,bkash,rocket,nogod,and all type of mobile banking and visa card payment)
*Implementing secure micropayment systems within the app

2. Notification Base:

This implies the app needs a robust notification system to keep users informed.
*Alerts for received donations or sent requests
*Updates on transaction status and completion
*Community notifications, announcements, or fundraising updates
